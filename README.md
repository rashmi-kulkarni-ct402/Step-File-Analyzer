# Project Title: STEP File Analyzer

# Description:
Step File Analyzer is a web application built using React, TypeScript, and Autodesk Platform Services Viewer to analyze and extract information from STEP files commonly used in manufacturing. The application allows users to upload STEP files, visualize them using Autodesk Viewer, and extract key properties for further analysis.

# Features:
1. **Upload and Visualization:** Users can upload STEP files through the web interface, and the application leverages Autodesk Platform Services Viewer to visualize the 3D models directly in the browser.
2. **Property Extraction:** Upon loading a STEP file, the application automatically extracts essential properties such as dimensions, materials, and geometrical data.
3. **Excel Export:** Extracted properties are presented to the user and can be exported to an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides an intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to upload, visualize, and analyze STEP files.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Being a web-based application, Step File Analyzer is accessible across various devices and operating systems without the need for additional software installations.

# Technologies Used:
1. **React:** For building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
2. **TypeScript:** To enhance code quality and maintainability through static typing.
3. **Autodesk Platform Services Viewer:** To render and interact with 3D models in the browser.
